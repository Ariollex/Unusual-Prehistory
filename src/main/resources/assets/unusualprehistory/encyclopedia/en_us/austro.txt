A relatively large dromaeosaur from the Late Cretaceous, these graceful creatures are docile unless provoked. They spend
most of their days hunting for fish and other small prey. These creatures have rather graceful plumage, with large prominent
red crests
adorning the side of their face and the top of their head. Sometimes they will groom themselves, leaving behind a few feathers
in the process.

These feathers can be used to craft boots that negate fall damage. These dinosaurs also drop meat on their
death. While not the best meat on the menu, other dinosaurs such as Ulughbegsaurus enjoy it.
