The largest land mammal to ever walk this planet, these creatures lived during the Oligocene.
Due to not having any living descendants, these creatures must be revived via a birthing pod. Their
size is also reflected in their behavior as for some unknown reason they seem to be extremely aggressive,
stomping and slamming anything that comes near them despite their herbivorous status.

While I am unsure why they are this hostile, the answer may lie within the black specks that seem to be writhing all
over them, though I need to do more thorough inspection.
