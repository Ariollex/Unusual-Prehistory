Kaprosuchus is a small crocodilian from the Upper Cretaceous period. Unlike many other crocodilians, this animal is much more
adapted to a more land-based lifestyle, allowing them to run fairly fast on land and hunt effectively. However this does not
mean they aren't well adapted to aquatic hunting, as their large tail allows for ample movement through the water. They are
fairly temperamental, not tolerating humans for long before attacking.

Despite their temperamental attitude, they can be tamed using Austroraptor Meat which they enjoy quite dearly. While tamed they
make extremely effective guard dogs, as their tough hide, strong bite force, and semi-aquatic capabilities allow them to be a
all terrain menace.
