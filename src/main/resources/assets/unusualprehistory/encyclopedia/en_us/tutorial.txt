Revival of ancient beasts is a fairly straightforward process. The first step in this process is finding fossils.
Fossils can be found in all layers in the world however depth affects age of them. There are 7 types of fossils:
Paleozoic Fossils, Mesozoic Fossils, Plant Fossils, Amber Fossils, Petrified Wood, Tar Fossils, and Opal Fossils.

To actually extract DNA however one must craft an Analyzer. Analyzers are a strange contraption
that allows for the extraction of DNA from fossils. To actually use this machine you have to use
flasks to hold the DNA in a stable place. This machine will then search for any traces
of DNA in the fossil.

Any DNA found will then have to be placed into a Cultivator. Cultivators are a curious machine that
turns DNA into actual creatures or plants. All one needs is DNA and some organic ooze, a curious slush of organic material
that allows for the revival process.

The process for reviving cenozoic and live birth creatures differs slightly, as after the cultivation process
an embryo is obtained. If a modern relative is available, then this can be used as a surrogate mother. However,
as of now there is only 1 known live-birth relative that still exists today for one animal. To get around this
one must construct a birthing pod, which allows for 1 live birth to happen before breaking.
