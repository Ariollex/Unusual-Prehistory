A massive orangutan hailing from the Early to Middle Pleistocene, these docile creatures may be one of the
most sophisticated creatures revived yet. Due to not having any living ancestors, these creatures must be revived via a birthing pod.
They spend most of their days milling about, exploring the world around them. However when presented with a revived ancient bamboo called
Zuloagae, they open up showing a wide array of goods.

While I am unsure where they get the goods, they offer a wide variety exotic goods hailing from never before seen fruits to
seemingly handcrafted weapons. When traded, they’ll give the buyer a massive fruit that seemingly has been stuffed to the
brim with random goods. Depending on what fruit you trade, better items are obtained. So far here is a list of everything
I have gotten from each “tier” of gigantopithecus fruit:
