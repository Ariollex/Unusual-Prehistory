A stegosaurid from the late Jurassic, these small dinosaurs are relatively peaceful creatures. They spend most of their
days grazing and moving through thick undergrowth. This lackadaisical lifestyle would at first glance make these creatures rather easy prey,
however the massive spikes on their sides and tail prevent this from happening. When fed a horsetail, these
dinosaurs will curl up into a defensive stance, preventing them from being moved while also damaging would be attackers.
