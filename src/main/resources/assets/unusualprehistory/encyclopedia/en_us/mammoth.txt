The most famous extinct mammal of them all, the great Wooly Mammoth. These large elephants roamed the cold
wastes from the Middle Pleistocene to Late Holocene. Their DNA can be obtained regularly through permafrost fossils,
however sometimes larger glacial icebergs will have entirely frozen specimens inside of them, bolstering a much
higher chance of mammoth DNA.

Due to not having any living ancestors, these creatures must be revived via a birthing pod. These large animals roam
in great herds, being quite defensive of their younger compatriots in the group. They also tend to follow the
eldest member of their species, who are usually indicated by their much greyer hair compared to others. One can actually earn
 the respect of these large beasts by wearing a Tyrant's Crown.

While wearing a tyrant's crown, theyâ€™ll protect the bearer as their own. Wearing this also allows for
one to take advantage of the elephants flexible trunks, allowing them to be armed with weapons to increase
their attack damage exponentially. Elder mammoths tend to have much higher health and damage than others,
making them deadly foes in the hands of a well-prepared individual.
