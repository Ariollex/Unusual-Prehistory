The most famous extinct mammal of them all, the great Wooly Mammoth. These large elephants roamed the cold
wastes from the Middle Pleistocene to Late Holocene. Their DNA can be obtained regularly through permafrost fossils,
however sometimes larger glacial icebergs will have entirely frozen specimens inside them, bolstering a much
higher chance of mammoth DNA.

Due to not having any living descendants, these creatures must be revived via a birthing pod. These large animals roam
in great herds, being quite defensive of their younger compatriots in the group. They also tend to follow the
eldest member of their species, who are usually indicated by their much greyer hair compared to others. One can actually earn
the respect of these large beasts by wearing a Tyrant's Crown.

While wearing a tyrant's crown, one can shear out various items that become caught in their fur. These can range from random junk
such as string or bones to the occasional brown wool. However, if one doesn't want to become the king of the mammoths they can be chopped
up and compressed into a extremely healthy meatball.
