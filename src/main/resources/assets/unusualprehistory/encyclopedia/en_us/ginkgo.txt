Prehistoric Ginkgo is a common tree that has been around since the Triassic and has been
florishing since then. These trees rarely drop their nuts when chopped, which can be cooked or fed to various
prehistoric animals. Ginkgo wood is yellow in color and can be crafted into a wide variety of wood products.
