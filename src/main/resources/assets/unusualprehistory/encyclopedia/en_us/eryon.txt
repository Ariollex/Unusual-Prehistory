Eryon was a small crustacean that roamed the earth during the Late Jurassic period. It was
found in the Solnhofen Limestone and inhabited coastal swamps and marshlands. These crustaceans
  are docile, often feeding off of microscopic organisms, but they also dig for things like food.
When digging around they have a chance of uncovering materials and junk, this includes;
bones, gold nuggets, iron nuggets, and string. They sometimes uncover preserved fossils
when digging which can be placed around as decoration!
