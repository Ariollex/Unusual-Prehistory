A very strange bird from the Holocene, these ducks lived in caves on islands living the troglodyte lifestyle,
spending their lives in the dark. These ducks prefer the dark, panicking in areas that are too bright. If one is
able to catch a duck, they can hold it on their heads. While the duck may panic, it will not flee as it is afraid of
heights. Talpanas will also dig in rooted dirt in search of food, digging up bits of hanging roots to be used for decoration purposes.
