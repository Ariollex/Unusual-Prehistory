While taming through conventional means proved to be futile, these animals do enjoy the sound of a fabled crocoarina, an
item that can only be obtained by bartering with a gigantopithecus. Hearing the tunes from this instrument seemingly forms
a bond with the musician, being loyal until the end. While saddling has proven futile, these beasts can be used as a powerful
tool in combat especially in numbers.
