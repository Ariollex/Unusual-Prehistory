An absolutely massive relative to the soggy elephant trunk snakes, these large creatures prefer to be in
rather large aquatic enclosures. These snakes also are entirely aquatic, as their muscles cannot hold themselves up outside of water.
A rather unique phenomena among this species of snakes is that they give live birth, as such due to not having any living descendants,
these creatures must be revived via a birthing pod.

These animals are temperamental, preferring to be unbothered. Over time, these large snakes will begin to shed, leaving behind trace
amounts of skin in the process. If one were to obtain this skin, even in its shed state it is durable enough to be fashioned into
Shedscale Armor. When the full set is worn, the wearer becomes extremely fast in the water and gains greater dexterity with opal items.
