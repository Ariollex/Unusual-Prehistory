Foxii, or Metasequoia foxii, is a extinct redwood tree known solely from the Paleocene. These massive
trees tower above their spruce relatives, almost doubling height of the tallest spruce trees.
To actually grow these trees, they need to be placed in a 2x2 area with lots of space. Be very wary
when growing these, as their stumps can easily reach 9 blocks thick, and their leaves larger. Their
wood is a dark red color and can be crafted into a variety of products.
