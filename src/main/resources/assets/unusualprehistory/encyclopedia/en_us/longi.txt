A small and colorful lizard from the Middle to Late Triassic period, living an arborial lifestyle. Something that was not accounted
for due to poor preservation was the increased amount of feathers on its back along with their sharpness and venomous properties.
To protect against the various predators of the triassic, they evolved to be a extremely defensive creature. This combined with their skittish
tendencies allowed for them to thrive.

Humans are not immune to their sharp and venomous spikes, however if a Longisquama is presented with some spider eyes they will gladly loosen up and
become tamed. While tamed, one can carefully hold these lizards. While holding, one can use their spines to their full potential offensively and defensively.
Do take note though that the lizard is still fairly frail.
