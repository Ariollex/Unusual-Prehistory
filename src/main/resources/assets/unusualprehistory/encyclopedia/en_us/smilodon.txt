Smilodon is a large cat hailing from the Early Pleistocene to Early Holocene, acting as one of the greatest
foils to early humanity for quite some time. These large felines DNA can be obtained regularly through permafrost
fossils, however sometimes larger glacial icebergs will have entirely frozen specimens inside them, bolstering
a much higher chance of smilodon DNA. Smilodons when revived will hunt humanoid creatures quite voraciously,
however they have a much softer side to them. When together they’ll begin to groom each other, leaving behind
bits of smilodon fur. For those brave enough to collect it, they’ll discover that this is a vital key in the construction of
birthing pods, which are vital to reviving ancient animals who don’t have a living descendant today.

Another key trait about smilodons is that they are one of the few creatures that actually have a modern relative alive today,
the humble Ocelot. They are one of the few creatures that can actually birth a living smilodon successfully, albeit with a skin tone
similar to that of their mother.
