A large monitor lizard from the Pleistocene, these large lizards are quite territorial. While
they will tolerate a person for some time, theyâ€™ll quickly lose their temper and attack with a wide
variety of claw swings, tail swipes and bites. Their bites inflict a rather dreadful venom that
reduces the maximum health. If one is brave enough to let a megalania lick their weapon, it will
temporarily be coated in this venom.

A very interesting behavior that these lizards have is their reaction
to colder and hotter temperatures. Lizards born in colder environments have different colors
than those in hot environments. Though be wary, as megalania in cold environments tend to sleep
while megalania in hot environments are much more active and aggressive.
