These medium-sized birds are from the Middle Oligocene and possibly the Late Pleistocene. Despite their relatively large size, these are actually the
smallest of their family the terror birds. Also unlike these birds they have a social hierarchy based on their coloration. Birds with a yellow head and
more grey feathers act as leaders of their packs. While alone these birds are fairly docile, however when grouped up they become more and more aggressive.

While not presenting any noteworthy uses for humans, these birds do drop their meat which is slightly more filling than chicken meat.
