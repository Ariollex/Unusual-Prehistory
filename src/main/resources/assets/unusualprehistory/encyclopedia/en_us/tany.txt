A rather long reptile from the Triassic, they act fairly similarly to modern day seals. They spend their time resting and basking on the shore, only
going to the shore or the ocean to get food. Sometimes they will find a non-organic object and hold it in their mouth. One can trade any sort of raw
fish to get this item from them.
