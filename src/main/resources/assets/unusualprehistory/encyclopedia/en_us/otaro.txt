A large fox-like mammal from the Oligocene, these nocturnal fiends are quite peculiar. Contrary to their fox-like looks, they are actually a part of an
order of mammals that are closely related to canines. Their closest relatives could get to the size and ferocity of a bear. However, these animals are
much more docile than their relatives, living a nocturnal lifestyle. They sleep in the day and roam at night, where they howl at night. These howls can
scare off hostile monsters, protecting them from any potential harm.

They are docile to humans, however one can take the extra step of taming these mammals using Raw Psilopterus. While tamed they will sometimes howl and scare
off hostile monsters while also acting as a fairly cute companion.
