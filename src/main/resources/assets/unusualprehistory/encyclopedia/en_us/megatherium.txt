While it may not seem it at first glance, these massive mammals are relatives to the now arboreal
sloths. Due to not having any living descendants, these creatures must be revived via a birthing pod.
These creatures thrived during the Early Pliocene to Early Holocene, feeding on now extinct fruits and
digging massive dens.

While their preferred fruits may be gone, if one were to spend the time and raise a baby sloth using
a sack and carrying it around, they may gain the trust of these animals. When tamed, they can be ridden
and used as great dirt excavators, digging lots of dirt in very small amounts of time.
