A medium sized ankylosaur that lived during the late Cretaceous, these hardy herbivores are one of the toughest dinosaurs.
Their hard scutes and sheer weight prevent them from being easily moved, not to mention their almost axe-like tails that can
slice most threats in half. These dinosaurs are rather defensive when it comes to hostile threats, as they will go after
just about any hostile monster with horrific results for the victim.

Sometimes during their slicing fests, they will lose a few of their tail scutes which can be fashioned into a rather crude
but effective heavy weapon. This weapon is said to be able to behead a ravager in one fell swoop.
