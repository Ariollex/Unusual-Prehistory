Cotlyorhynchus is a massive browser of immense width who feeds upon bushes of fern and horsetails with
their abysmally small heads. These cow-like herbivores are closer to mammalian ancestors than any archosaurs
despite their resemblance to some sauropods, and they behave the part with their massive stomachs that digest
fibrous plant matter easily. Their meat is quite nutritious.
