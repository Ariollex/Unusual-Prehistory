A rather broad group of shelled cephalopods found commonly throughout history, only going extinct during the
Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event. These animals filled a variety of niches from small filter feeders to stealthy predators.
They can be captured in buckets and be transplanted to other bodies of water or aquariums.

On death they drop shell shards which can be used to create a full ammonite shell, a must-have for many fossil collectors, or a War Pick.

 War picks are equally good at mining as they are in combat situations, allowing for good damage in combat situations.
