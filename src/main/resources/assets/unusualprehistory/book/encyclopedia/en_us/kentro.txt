A stegosaurid from the late Jurassic, these small dinosaurs are relatively peaceful creatures. They spend most of their
days grazing and moving through thick undergrowth. This lackadaisical lifestyle would at first glance make these creatures
rather easy prey, however their massive side and tail spikes prevent this from happening. When fed a horsetail, these
dinosaurs will curl up into a defensive stance, preventing them from being moved while also damaging would be attackers.
