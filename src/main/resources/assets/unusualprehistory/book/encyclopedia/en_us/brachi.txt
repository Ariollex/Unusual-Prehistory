These massive Jurassic sauropods are quite the sight to behold, standing over 13 blocks tall. These gargantuan animals spend
most of their time grazing on tall trees, paying little attention to the world around them. With such a large size, many have
attempted to saddle these beasts for warfare. However, these attempts mostly fail as these large dinosaurs dislike being ridden,
throwing their rider away to extreme heights. These beasts cannot be ridden as teens as they are too rambunctious.

Though they mean no ill will as they bless there would be riders with divine protection,
protecting them from fall damage. Skilled people use this to their advantage, making them living elytra launchers.
