A cretaceous frog of immense proportions, Beelzebufo is considered to be an extinct relative of the ceratophryidae,
which is a part of the frog group that diverged from primitive amphibians during the late cretaceous and contains,
in modern day, hornfrogs. Much like their modern relatives, these massive frogs have a very voracious appetite, consuming
most small animals in their path.

Due to their large size, these animals can be saddled and ridden, however they can only be controlled using meat on a stick.
These frogs can be controlled to hop fairly high, though some individual frogs jump much higher than their counterparts.
When feeding these animals can somtimes leave excess saliva which acts as a unique bonding agent that allows for the
creation of name tags.
