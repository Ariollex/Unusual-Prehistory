A rather small crab from the Late Jurassic that roamed coastal swamps and marshlands. These crabs are docile,
spending most of their days feeding on microscopic organisms and loafing around.
Sometimes while digging, these creatures can uncover hidden materials such as various nuggets,
junk, and rarely even very preserved fossils.
