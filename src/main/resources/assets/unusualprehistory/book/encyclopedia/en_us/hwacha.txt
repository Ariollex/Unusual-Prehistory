One of the most anomalous finds from the rare amber, classifying this dinosaur was extremely hard due to its rather
mythical abilities. A current theory is that this dinosaur is a neotheropod  that survived into the
late Jurassic era. This medium-sized theropod has a rather deadly hunting tactic. Through a series of complex biological
processes, this dinosaur can launch a barrage of sharp spines from its frills being able to gun down most threats.

Whats even more shocking and to an extent horrifying is these creatures' ability to be tamed by giving it a King's Buffet.
When tamed these dinosaurs can launch their pins in any direction the owner would like.
