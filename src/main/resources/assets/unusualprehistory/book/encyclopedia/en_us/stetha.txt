A small shark-like holocephali from the late devonian to the late carboniferous. These small sharks exhibit an
unusual anvil-like protrusion on their head. This is theorized to have been for mating purposes but the true
purpose is unknown. These animals can be bucketed and be moved to another body of water or an aquarium.
On death one can eat their flesh for a decent but not fulfilling meal.
