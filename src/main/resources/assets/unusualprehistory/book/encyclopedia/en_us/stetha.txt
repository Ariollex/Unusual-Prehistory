Holocephalians are among the strangest fish to swim the primordial depths, and within the clade some of the strangest
chordates to exist had evolved. Within these layers of strangeception lies the Stethacanthus, a small symmoriform holocephalian
originally considered to be a shark. Only recently had they been reclassified as a holocephalian along their eugneodont allies
and many other early chondricthyes, and it is more and more likely that they were the precursors for the elasmobranchs to follow.
Stethacanthus are odd little fish of massive eyes and a strange protrusion upon its head.

This organ, modified from their first dorsal fins is as mysterious in function as its shape, and it has been theorized to either
serve as a mark of sexual dimorphism or as a mating assistance, akin to the cephalic claspers on modern male ratfish. The thorns
that cover a Stethacanthus’ protrusion are harmless due to their size, and resurrected specimens are often found in pet
stores as a popular children’s pet, but they are considered to be more demanding in terms of husbandry than their smaller
relative, Falcatus.
