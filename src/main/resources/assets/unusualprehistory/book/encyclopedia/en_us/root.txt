Revival of ancient beasts is a fairly straightforward process. The first step in this process is finding fossils.
Fossils can be found in all layers in the world, however the deeper you go the older fossils get. There are 3 types
of fossils: Paleozoic Fossils, Mesozoic Fossils, and Plant Fossils.

To actually extract DNA however one must craft an Analyzer. Analyzers are a strange contraption
that allows for the extraction of DNA from fossils. To actually use this machine you have to use
flasks to hold the DNA in a stable place. This machine will then search for any traces
of DNA in the fossil

Any DNA found will then have to be placed into a Cultivator. Cultivators are a curious machine that
turns DNA into actual creatures. All one needs is DNA and some organic ooze, a curious slush of organic material
that allows for the revival process.

The next few pages detail various information on the behaviors of revived extinct animals, including useful tips
and uses that are associated with them.
