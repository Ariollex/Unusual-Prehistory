Oddities in the pterosaur families for their flat faces and forward - facing eyes, Anurognathus look more akin to a frog -
owl than any preexisting pterosaur. These tiny flappers, considered to be a sister group of pterodactyloids and more obviously
pterosaur animals that they themselves are not, are big - eyed nocturnal insectivores, behaving similarly to a reptilian bat
as they swoop through the night.

They supplement their insectoid diet with nectar from flowers many times smaller than their own body, but
sustain their flight all the same, and some plants can rely on anurognathids to pollinate their offspring. Potential
pterosaur - keepers beware however, they are not compatible with bees and should never be kept in an apiary.
