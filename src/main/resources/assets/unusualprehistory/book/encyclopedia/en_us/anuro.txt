A small pterosaur that lived during the late jurassic. These small pterosaurs are quite unusual compared to others of their kin,
having fairly short and stocky bodies with massive eyes. Their teeth are also much more adapted towards hunting insects,
which they do with great skill. While their main prey tends to be insects, these pterosaurs also snack on nectar from flowers.
This behavior makes them an amazing all pollinator.
