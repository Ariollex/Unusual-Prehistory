Strange island-borne Abelisaurs of the late Cretaceous period. A Majungasaurusâ€™ binocular eyes allow them to track mobile prey with ease,
and their powerfully long legs propel them towards their prey with a surprising burst of speed. While aggressive, these creatures are rather clumsy,
unlike their relatives there charges are fairly inaccurate, though this does not mean there bite is not strong. Do be wary keeping individuals
together, as the species is known for cannibalism. Feeding these animals a chunk of raw Cotlyorhynchus pacifies them for awhile.

Their horn is not tough enough to penetrate a shield, if they ram into a shield they may get stunned and scutes on their
head may loosen and fall off, these can be collected by the player. These scutes can be made into a helmet that grants strength.
