A medium sized abelisaurid theropod dinosaur from the late cretaceous. These theropods have a somewhat odd appearance,
with small forearms and strange faces with large eyes. These eyes allow for very precise hunting, being able to make precise
movements at its targets. These dinosaurs are fairly tolerable of any humanoids though the same cannot be said of any small
animals. When provoked, these animals will charge at their foe launching them far away while dealing decent damage.

If one were to block one of these charges, they could possibly cause a scute to fall off the theropod.
These scutes can be forged into a tough helmet that boosts one strength.
