Strange island - borne abelisaurs of the late cretaceous, these natives of Madagascar were thought to be pachycephalosaurs
in times long forgotten, but the current scientific consensus for these strange theropods are that they are closely related
to other abelisaurs such as rugops and rajasaurus. A Majungasaurusâ€™ binocular eyes allow them to track mobile prey with ease,
and their powerfully long legs propel them towards their prey with a surprising burst of speed.

They are not the most skittish of creatures within their group, but an agitated Majungasaurus will charge at their
stressor at a dangerous speed. Their singular cephalic horn is not sufficient to penetrate a shield however,
and a loosened scute or two is typically enough to discourage an annoyed Majungasaurus from advancing its offence.
