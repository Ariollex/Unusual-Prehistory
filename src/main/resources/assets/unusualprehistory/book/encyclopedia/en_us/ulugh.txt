A dubious theropod from the Late Cretaceous period, these medium-sized dinosaurs are
rather tame as they seem to be more used to chasing beach dwellers rather than bigger game.

However, one of their most unique traits is their crest colors. These crest colors determine what
style of life these dinosaurs live.
Blue crest-colored individuals are much faster, being more adapted to chasing down prey.
White crest-colored individuals are more bulky, much more adapted to fending off predators or rivals.
Orange crest-colored individuals have much more powerful bites, allowing them to crack bones for nutrients.
Yellow crest-colored individuals have a special venom that disables joints, particularly in the arms, this will prevent the player from doing any actions with their hands besides mining and attacking
Brown crest-colored individuals have are very durable, having thick scales that protect the animal.

These creatures are also relatively easy to tame and ride, as their preferred foods are
indicated by their crest colors. So far, I have found that the following foods can tame these
crest colors.

White: Raw Austroraptor

Blue: Raw Scaumencia

Yellow: Golden Scaumencia

Orange: Raw Coty

Brown: Raw Stethacanthus

There is a high chance that more crest colors exist that I have yet to document and more
foods I have yet to discover for taming.
