A dubious therapod from the late cretaceous period, these medium size dinosaurs are rather tame as they seem to be more
used to scavenging rather than chasing down prey. However one of their most unique traits is their crest colors. These
crest colors determine what style of life these dinosaurs live. Blue crested individuals are much faster, being more adapted
to chasing down prey. White crested individuals are much bulkier, much more adapt to fending off predators or rivals.
Orange crested individuals have much more powerful bites, allowing them to crack bone for nutrients. Yellow crested individuals
have a special venom that disables the joints, preventing eating or in the case of humans using shields.

These creatures are also fairly easy to tame and ride, as there prefered food is indicated by their crest color.
So far I have found that these foods can tame these crest colors.

There is a high change that more crest colors exist that I have yet to document and foods I have to discover for taming.
