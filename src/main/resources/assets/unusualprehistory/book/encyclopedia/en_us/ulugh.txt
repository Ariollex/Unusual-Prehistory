A dubious theropod from the Late Cretaceous period, these medium-sized dinosaurs are
rather tame as they seem to be more used to scavenging than chasing down prey.

However, one of their most unique traits is their crest colors. These crest colors determine what
style of life these dinosaurs live.
Blue crest-colored individuals are much faster, being more adapted to chasing down prey.
White crest-colored individuals are more bulky, much more adapted to fending off predators or rivals.
Orange crest-colored individuals have much more powerful bites, allowing them to crack bones for nutrients.
Yellow crest-colored individuals have a special venom that disables joints, preventing eating, including humans using shields.

These creatures are also relatively easy to tame and ride, as their preferred foods are
indicated by their crest colors. So far, I have found that the following foods can tame these
crest colors.

White: Raw Austroraptor

Blue: Raw Scaumencia

Yellow: Golden Scaumencia

Orange: Raw Coty

There is a high chance that more crest colors exist that I have yet to document and more
foods I have yet to discover for taming.
