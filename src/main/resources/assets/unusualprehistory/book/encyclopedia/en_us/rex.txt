The most famous of the dinosaurs, these massive therapods hail from the cretaceous period. While neutral to people at first,
if hit these creatures become quite ferocious in their rage.
<NEWLINE>
The Tyrannosaurus can dish out a variety of attacks from a weak stomp that causes a small cloud of weakness to a deadly tail whip that
launches attackers back. Their most deadly attack however is their devastating bite attack. This attack can easily destroy weaker
shields and can nearly instantly kill most prey.

The best way to deal with this creature in its enraged state is to come prepared with potions, tough armor, and golden apples for
resistance and regeneration. When the beast is almost near death it will fall into a weakened state. During this state it cannot attack
or move. When an Adorned Staff is used on it in this state it will heal up and drop some rewards.
<NEWLINE>
These rewards consist of scales and teeth. Scales can be used to craft a fine trophy of the beast while
the teeth can be used to craft a veloci-shield. Another by product of the pacification is that they will
become completely pacified, not attacking humans nor animals that hurt it.
