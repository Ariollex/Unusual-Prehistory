Apex predators of the late devonian, the only creature that threatened a Dunkleosteusâ€™ presence is its own kind.
Their gaping maws are uniquely adapted with extremely fast-acting muscles that open their jaws in an instant,
creating a pressure difference that sucks in their armoured prey at range, which they ambush in dark waters akin to
a catfish of the modern times.

Dunkleosteus tolerates no other organisms in its vicinity, and attacks anything that approaches near them.
Husbandry and captive maintainance with these placoderms are quite challenging in that they will often attack
their handlers, and their constantly-sharpened jawblades part armour with ease, yet these jawblades also extract
extra nutrients and useful material from their prey. These beasts are quite fond of Scaumenacia and can even be passifed
using gold encrusted ones. Though this passification causes the fish to no longer attack any animals, taking away from its
extracting capabilities.
