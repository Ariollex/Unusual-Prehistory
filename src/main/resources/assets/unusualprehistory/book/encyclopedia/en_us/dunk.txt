A large fish from the late devonian. During their time, these massive fish were the top predators with
the only real competition being each other. These fish had very large mouths, being able to suck in prey with
the sheer force of how fast their mouths open. These fish have very short tempers and usually end up attacking
anything that nears them. This can make working with these fish quite the dangerous task as their bites
usually slice through most armor.
